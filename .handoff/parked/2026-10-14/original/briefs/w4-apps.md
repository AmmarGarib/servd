# Wave B builder brief — w4-apps: Tablet Emergency overrides tab and code-only dispatch; rider apps: rerouted-code banner, 'Problem at the door', cash-held reminder

Repo `/home/user/servd` — backend = Fastify + Prisma in `backend/`, admin = Next.js in `frontend/admin/`, storefront in
`frontend/storefront/`, `tablet/`, `mobile/`, `rider/` Expo apps. Read `/home/user/servd/CLAUDE.md` first: it applies in full.
Wave: **W4** · Area: **tablet + rider apps (Expo + web rider)** · UI agent — no database, no tests to run
Design inputs (read the parts named below): `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/dump/plan_<area>.json` (area plans), `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/dump/critic_*.json` (critic corrections —
already folded into this brief), `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/schema-merged.prisma.md`, `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/chart-merged.md`, `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/shared-files.md`,
`/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/build-waves.md`. Where this brief and an area plan differ, THIS BRIEF wins (it carries the critic corrections and the
cross-area merges). Line numbers quoted from plans may have drifted: find the code by name.

## Your job in one line

UI only — tablet overrides/dispatch/_layout, rider/** (Expo), storefront /rider web pages + riderApi, docs/rider-app.md.

W1-W3 are merged: code against the API and helpers as they are ON DISK (read the files). Nothing after you edits your files except the orchestrator in wave Z.


## Binding decisions (read before anything else)

Owner decisions 2026-10-13 (/home/user/servd/.handoff/fixes/owner-decisions-20261013.md), as merged by the integration architect:
- Upgrade the EXISTING fixed-asset register and food cost (no duplicates; food cost = one variance report under Reports; the old
  /accounting/food-cost link forwards).
- Cash requests replace the voucher flow: anyone raises → HOD signs → director (CEO) approves → Jamil sb (box custodian) pays and marks
  paid (no photo) → the holder uploads receipts → that books the expense (advance on 1355 until then, H3/H4).
- Petty cash is funded by the Garibsons cashier (GS Foods holds no cash): Dr 1011 / Cr 2210 Due to Garibsons (H1). servd records only the cash-in.
- Delivery completes ONLY with the customer's code; no staff "Delivered" override. Refused/unpaid → the rider brings the food back → booked as
  food WASTE by the RGM / chef / F&B manager through the new "Emergency overrides" section (send the code to the rider's number; log
  returned food). Strikes: refused-at-door = strike; 3 strikes block the customer (account, email, number) PER COMPANY; a blocked customer can
  appeal to the help desk.
- Fixed assets: depreciation AUTOMATIC monthly; no threshold; smallwares grouped in pools; big items individual; disposals/scraps/write-downs:
  finance requests, CEO approves (F&B manager NOT); no opening/pre-servd assets; equipment only via CapEx.
- Food cost: split food / drinks / packaging; real-time at the PO price of the lots actually cooked (FIFO); per-outlet stock is the NEXT build
  (tag the outlet now).
- Delivery fee carries sales tax, ADDED ON TOP. On-account corporate clients with a credit limit and a QR card the cashier scans; no manager
  approval per bill; finance invoices monthly (statements). Bad-debt write-off: the CEO approves every one. Raast "void, never booked": CEO only.
  Wrong-brand Raast QR: no change. G15 (dead "Purchase order coming soon" button) → fix.

**PACKAGING RULE — FINAL (owner, 2026-10-13, the LAST answer; it overrides every earlier packaging message, including the
"no exceptions / no brand setting" message the owner withdrew: "Ok nvm do what we originally planned and [do] the brand primary setting
thing. With the button it makes sense"):**
- every finished (plate) recipe ALWAYS has an optional Packaging section (all brands, plated ones like Simmer included);
- whether a sale uses its packaging depends on the ORDER TYPE and the BRAND: `packagingApplies(order, concept, line)` in lib/recipeCost.ts =
  order is takeaway or delivery (incl. storefront pickup/delivery, rider, WhatsApp pickup) → TRUE; else the brand's primary service vessel is
  'packaging' (e.g. Stackd — packaging IS the service vessel) → TRUE; else (dine-in at a plate brand) → TRUE only when staff tapped
  "Box given" on that line (leftovers boxed);
- Concept.serviceVessel 'plate' | 'packaging' (NOT NULL, default 'plate'): a REQUIRED choice when a brand is created (create-brand form + API)
  and editable in Marketing → Brands; backfill stackd = 'packaging', every other brand 'plate'; a change applies from then on (the vessel is
  snapshotted on the order line, never restating past cost);
- OrderItem.boxGiven (Boolean default false) + boxGivenAt / boxGivenById: the "Box given" button on the till / admin order / KDS-expo for
  dine-in lines (any staff of the order's company; audited; undo allowed until the order completes); it depletes the line's packaging lots
  (FIFO, Dr 5030 / Cr 1230) and adds the packaging to the line's actual MC;
- stock depletion and the books follow the same rule: a line whose packaging does not apply depletes no packaging;
- TARGET MC (material cost) = food + drinks + packaging-if-it-applies-to-that-order-type; ACTUAL MC = food + drinks + packaging actually used;
  the variance report shows MC by order type (dine-in / takeaway / delivery) and by brand;
- a recipe needs no packaging lines to be approved (a plate brand with dine-in only is valid); a packaging-vessel brand's recipe WITHOUT
  packaging lines raises a warning on the recipe and in the report (not a block);
- the existing `Recipe.qFactorPct` stays the ONLY pricing allowance (the "Q factor" that pays off the plate, H18): pricing/theoretical only,
  never posted; plate cost reaches the books through smallwares depreciation.

Accountant defaults in force (Hasnain H1–H30, 'In servd now'; Hasnain may change later — keep each one a single switch point):
H1 Garibsons cash → 2210 Due to Garibsons · H2 own petty-cash account 1011; boxes' history treated as from the safe (1010) · H3 cash request =
advance on 1355; receipt books Dr expense / Cr 1355; change back to the box; unsettled after 30 days becomes a staff advance (HR loan, 1350)
or the director's current account (1356) · H4 director's current account · H5 delivered COD not handed in = receivable from the rider (1351) ·
H6 gratuity at exit (30 days' last gross per completed year, > 6 months counts, permanent staff with 1+ year, booked when the F&F is approved) ·

## Already done by the orchestrator in wave 0 (use it, never redo or edit it)

- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` + migrations `20261014085900_finance_wave_b_enums` and `20261014090000_finance_wave_b`, client generated —
  exactly `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/schema-merged.prisma.md`. If you truly need another column/table/index, STOP and say so in your report.
- `backend/src/lib/chartOfAccounts.ts` (new codes, REQUIRED list, `assertTemplateAccounts`, `REGISTER_CONTROLLED_CODES`) and
  `backend/src/modules/accounting/journal.ts` (ACCT constants, `TILL_CLEARING_CODES`, `ON_ACCOUNT_MEMO`, `CONTROLLED_PREFIX`, the
  controlled-account rule with `controlledOverride`, `lateDatingFor`) — exactly `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-servd/33ef43a5-b49c-56f9-95d2-440e3a7d20b8/scratchpad/waveB/chart-merged.md`.

  `approvals/types.ts` APPROVAL_TYPES; `lib/moduleAccess.ts` + `lib/workspaces.ts` (module ids food_cost + emergency_overrides, GATED rules);
  `reconciliation/routes.ts` registering stub child plugins (cardPayoutRoutes, codRoutes, pettyCashBackfillRoutes);
  `reconciliation/backfillOrders.ts` exporting placeAndPost / Reposter / RefusedDoc / withBackfillSlot; `tests/setup.ts` (seeds every template
  code, applies the SQL-only CHECKs + partial uniques); `tests/moneyBigint.test.ts` canary; admin `lib/appRoles.ts`, `lib/moduleCatalog.ts`,
  `next.config.js` redirect, `app/exceptions/page.tsx` labels; `packages/types` order modifierId + delivery fee fields.
- `backend/src/index.ts` is NOT touched until wave Z: tests register the plugin they test on their own Fastify instance (see
  tests/connectorsFixtures.ts buildApp). Give the orchestrator the exact registration / worker-start / boot / /health snippet in your report.

## Read first

- plan_delivery.json build_split F; routes (rider jobs handover/doorProblem, door-problem, shift cashHeldCents)
- critic_cash_delivery_onaccount_0.json violations 4 (tablet Delivered → Enter customer's code), Q3 (show the rerouted code in the app as a fallback)

## What to build

- **Tablet:** a new Overrides tab (NAV_MODULES ['emergency_overrides']) with the same list and the two actions as the admin page (send code to the
  rider; food came back with cause + reason + the waste preview); Dispatch: remove Delivered, confirmDelivered and the local MANAGER_ROLES; add 'Enter
  customer's code' (verify-otp); a locked code shows 'Ask a manager: Emergency overrides'.
- **Rider apps (Expo `rider/` and web servd.pk/rider):** Job type gains `handover { rerouted, reroutedAt, code, whatsappSent }` and `doorProblem { kind,
  at } | null`; when rerouted to this rider: a banner 'A manager sent the code to your WhatsApp' with the code shown as a fallback and a 'Use this code'
  fill; the copy says take the cash first, then enter the code; a 'Problem at the door' sheet (Customer can't get the code / Customer refused or won't
  pay / Can't reach the customer) → POST /rider/jobs/:orderId/door-problem, then guidance 'Bring the food back to <outlet>; a manager logs it'; a
  locked code shows 'Call your manager — they can send the code to you'; going off shift with cashHeldCents > 0 shows a reminder (never a block);
  JobCard: a 'Code sent to you' chip. No emoji on the web rider (storefront rule); the web rider stays noindex with no servd chrome.
- **Tablet floor (Box given):** if floor.tsx shows a dine-in table's order lines, add the same 'Box given' toggle as the till (POST
  /pos/orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/box-given, undo while open; only on dine-in lines whose vessel is plate); if it shows no lines, leave it and
  say so in your report.
- **docs/rider-app.md:** rewrite the hand-over code section (code only; reroute; door problems; returned food) and the endpoint table.

## Contracts you consume (already on disk when you start)

- w1-dlv-core rider routes (handover, doorProblem, door-problem, cashHeldCents); w3-dlv-return emergency-overrides routes (tablet tab).


## Contracts you expose (later waves code against these — keep the names and signatures)
(UI only — none)

## Checks

UI agent — no tests. Run `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` in tablet/, rider/ and frontend/storefront and make your files clean. Checklist: rider web job page
with a rerouted code; the door-problem sheet; tablet Overrides tab gated by the module.


## Rules for this UI agent (CLAUDE.md applies in full)

1. **Ownership.** Edit ONLY the files listed under "You own". Backend files and every file another agent owns: put the exact snippet in your
   report ("patch notes"). The API contract is the one in this brief and in the backend agents' files already on disk (read them: route
   files, zod schemas, response shapes). If the API on disk differs from this brief, follow the API on disk and report the difference.
2. **Admin:** tokens only (`var(--erp-*)`, `rgb(var(--x-rgb) / a)`, `color-mix(in srgb, <token> 10%, transparent)`, `s-badge-*`,
   `text-success`); purple = actions/identity, green = state/good news (switches on, selected chips, progress, paid/on-target), red = bad;
   never hard-code a colour or append hex alpha; no emoji structural icons; money typed in RUPEES and converted to paisa; plain English;
   works at phone width with no horizontal scroll; every error code the API returns is shown in words; never a local role list — use
   `lib/roles.ts` or the capability flags the API returns (canApprove, canVoid …); pages call only paths their module can open
   (`canOpenPath`).
3. **Storefront / mobile / tablet / rider:** servd pages use `--servd-*` tokens (white, green #87c540 primary with deep-purple text,
   purple #6a0dad secondary); brand pages keep their own palettes; brand names through `formatBrandName()`; no emoji on storefront or the
   web rider; SVG or text labels only.
4. **No builds, no dev servers, no tests to run, no commits.** Run `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` in each app you touched and make YOUR files clean
   (report errors in files you do not own). The orchestrator runs the builds and screenshots in wave Z.


## Report format (your final message is the return value — no separate report file)

1. Files created / changed / deleted (paths).
2. Routes added/changed: method, path, guard (roles), module gate, scope mode, body, responses, error codes.
3. Postings: Dr/Cr, `sourceType:sourceId`, company source, date rule, where it runs (which transaction).
4. Contracts you EXPOSE (exact TypeScript signatures, file paths) — later waves code against these.
5. Tests: files written/updated, the exact command run, pass/fail counts; failures you believe belong to another agent's in-flight work.
6. `tsc` result for your files.
7. Patch notes: exact snippets for files you do not own (orchestrator or the next owner applies them).
8. Deviations from this brief and why; owner/accountant questions still open (with the default you built); anything still wrong.
